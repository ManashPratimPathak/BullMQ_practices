## Requirements

For development, you will need to have Node.js, `pnpm`, and Docker installed in your environment.

### Node
- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go to the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer. Ensure that `git` is available in your PATH as `pnpm` might need it.

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install Node.js and npm easily with apt install. Run the following commands:

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  For more information about installation, visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following commands.

    $ node --version
    v14.17.0

    $ npm --version
    7.13.0

    $ pnpm --version
    6.16.1

If you need to update `npm` or `pnpm`, you can do it using the respective package manager. After running the following commands, open the command line again.

    $ npm install -g npm
    $ npm install -g pnpm

### pnpm installation

After installing Node.js, this project will need `pnpm` too. Run the following command:

    $ npm install -g pnpm

### Docker installation

Install Docker by following the instructions on the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/).

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BullMQ_practices
    $ cd BullMQ_practices
    $ pnpm install

## Configure app

Open `a/nice/path/to/a.file` then edit it with your settings. You will need:

- A setting;
- Another setting;
- One more setting;

## Running the project

### Using Docker and Redis

Before running the project, make sure you have Docker running. Then, run the following command:

    $ docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis-container redis

This command will start a Redis container. Now you can start your project:

    $ pnpm start

## Simple build for production

    $ pnpm build

### Stopping Docker container

If you want to stop the Redis container, run:

    $ docker stop redis-container
